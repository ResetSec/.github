**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

## Welcome to Reset Security!

We are a CTF Team created by some nerds on Reddit that hopped into a discord together and instantly became a big, weird, international family :P 

Here will be our CTF Writeups, Scripts, Codebases, and whatever else makes sense to put here. 

For general, non-event specific information check out the [wiki](https://github.com/ResetSec/.github/wiki). If you are member of the team, miscellaneous contributions and general research should go here! 

ps. we are a bit lazy and sometimes we dont do writeups 😛
pps. the wiki is still TODO 😅
