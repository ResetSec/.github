## Welcome to Reset Security!

We are a CTF Team created by some nerds on Reddit that hopped into a discord together and instantly became a big, weird, international family :P 

Here will be our CTF Writeups, Scripts, Codebases, and whatever else makes sense to put here. 

#### If you are a interested in becoming a member of the team or a member of this GH Org, please join the discord.

In the discord you will see collaboration, upcoming events, links, and general schenanigans.
